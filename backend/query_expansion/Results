It is the ninth oldest museum in the world and the oldest, as well as the largest museum in Asia, by size of collection . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] It has rare collections of antiques, armour and ornaments, fossils, skeletons, mummies and Mughal paintings . It was founded by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Kolkata (Calcutta), India , in 1814. The founder curator was Nathaniel Wallich , a Danish botanist.\nIt has six sections comprising thirty five galleries of cultural and scientific artifacts namely Indian art , archaeology , anthropology , geology , zoology and economic botany . Many rare and unique specimens, both Indian and trans-Indian, relating to humanities and natural sciences, are preserved and displayed in the galleries of these sections. In particular the art and archaeology sections hold collections of international importance.\nIt is an autonomous organization under the Ministry of Culture , Government of India . The present Director of the Indian Museum is Shri Arijit Dutta Choudhury who is also the Director General, NCSM and having the additional charge of Director General of National Library . [ 10 ]\nHistory\n[ edit ]\nThe Indian Museum originated from the Asiatic Society of Bengal which was created by Sir William Jones in 1784. The concept of having a museum arose in 1796 from members of the Asiatic Society as a place where man-made and natural objects collected could be kept, cared for and displayed.\nThe objective began to look achievable in 1808 when the Society was offered suitable accommodation by the Government of India in the Chowringhee-Park Street area. [ 11 ]\nOn 2 February 1814, Nathaniel Wallich , a Danish botanist, who had been captured in the siege of Serampore but later released, wrote to the council of the Asiatic Society for the formation of a museum out of his own collection and that of the Asiatic Society in Calcutta, volunteering his service as a Curator wherein he proposed five sections—an archaeological, ethnological, a technical section and a geological and zoological one. [ 12 ] The council readily agreed and the Museum was created, with Wallich named the Honorary Curator and then Superintendent of the Oriental Museum of the Asiatic Society . Wallich also donated a number of botanical specimens to the museum from his personal collection. In 1815, Mr William Lloyd Gibbons, Asst Secretary and Librarian, was appointed Joint Secretary of the Museum.\nThe Indian Museum, as completed in 1875, photo c. \u20091905\nAfter the resignation of Wallich, curators were paid salaries by the Asiatic Society ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 200 a month. However, in 1836, when the bankers of the Asiatic Society (Palmer and Company) became insolvent, the Government began to pay the salary of the Curator from its public funds since a large part of the collection was that of the surveyors of Survey of India.\nA temporary grant of Rs 200 per month was sanctioned for maintenance of the museum and library, and J. T. Pearson of the Bengal Medical Service was appointed curator, followed shortly by John McClelland and, after the former\'s resignation, by Edward Blyth .\nIn 1840, the Government took a keen interest in geology and mineral resources, and this led to an additional grant of Rs 250 per month for the geological section alone. In 1851 when the Geological Survey of India came into being with the advent of Sir Thomas Oldham, a rented building at 1, Hastings Road now K N Roy Road, the present site of the New Secretariat became its office. The geological collection of the Government of India \'Museum of Economic Geology\' at the Asiatic Society, were then transferred to this site in 1856. The Asiatic Society geological collection were however held back with the condition that it would be handed over to the GSI once a Museum for all its collection came into being. It was way back in 1837 that Sir James Princeps, then-Secretary of the Asiatic Society, had written to the Government asking for a Museum paid for by the state. A movement for a full-fledged Museum was thereafter keenly pursued over a decade, and later, with Sir Thomas Oldham, then Superintendent of the Geological Survey of India, at the helm, it gained momentum.\nThe torana and railings (part) from the Bharhut Stupa, before 75 BC\nThe thrust for a full-fledged Museum was held up due to the intervention of the revolt of the sepoys of the East India Company. The matter was pursued again, once things settled down after India came under the Crown.\nThereafter the First Indian Museum Act was passed in 1866 and the foundation of the Indian Museum at its present site laid in 1867. In 1875 the present building on Chowringee Road, presently Jawaharlal Nehru Road, designed by W L Granville in consultation with Sir Thomas Holland, on Chowringee was completed. In 1877 after the retirement of Sir Thomas Oldham in 1876 the Geological Survey of India including the Museum of Economic Geology shifted here from its rented accommodation on 1 Hastings Road.\nStone sculpture of Devi Durga\nThis building had been designated as the site for not just the Asiatic Societies, Oriental Museum\'s collection and the Economic Geology collection of the Geological Survey of India but also to hold the offices of both.\nThe Asiatic Society however relinquished its rights preferring to maintain its autonomy from the government. The Geological Survey of India is till date headquartered at the buildings of the Indian Museum Complex and holds exclusive rights over the Geological galleries of the Indian Museum.\nThe building parallel to Sudder Street commenced in 1888 and occupied in 1891. The next building block at right angle to Sudder Street was erected in 1894. Half of this building was consigned to the Geological Survey of India but by 1912 it was wholly transferred to it.\nThe Zoological and Anthropological sections of the museum gave rise to the Zoological Survey of India in 1916, which in turn gave rise to the Anthropological Survey of India in 1945. [ 13 ]\nThe Scottish anatomist and zoologist John Anderson took up the position of curator in 1865, and catalogued the mammal and archaeology collections. The English zoologist James Wood-Mason worked at the museum from 1869 and succeeded Anderson as curator in 1887. [ 14 ]\nThe museum was closed to visitors for restoration and upgrades from September 2013 to February 2014. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]\nCollections\n[ edit ]\nEgyptian human mummy, about 4,000 years old, at the museum. [ 17 ]\nEgyptian\n[ edit ]\nIt currently occupies a resplendent mansion, and exhibits among others: an Egyptian mummy. The mummy is being restored. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ]\nIndian\n[ edit ]\nThe large collection of ancient and medieval Indian artifacts include the complete railings and gateways of the Buddhist\nstupa from Bharhut (the bare stupa is still at Bharhut, near Satna , MP). The Bharhut panels are unique in that they are inscribed in the Brahmi script . The museum has a collection of the remains of the slightly later Amaravati Stupa . There is a large and representative collection of Buddhist and Hindu sculptures of the medieval period, especially those from Bengal, Bihar , and Odisha .\nAlso preserved are Buddha \'s relics, a copy of the Lion Capital of Ashoka from an Ashoka pillar (original in the Sarnath Museum ) whose four-lion symbol became the official emblem of the Republic of India , fossil skeletons of prehistoric animals, an art collection, rare antiques, and a collection of meteorites.\nThe Indian Museum is also regarded as "the beginning of a significant epoch initiating the socio-cultural and scientific achievements of the country. It is otherwise considered as the beginning of the modernity and the end of medieval era". [ 21 ]\nNatural History\n[ edit ]\nBust of the Moravian – Indian paleontologist Ferdinand Stoliczka in the paleontology section\nThe museum has four galleries dedicated to natural history, namely the botanical, insect, mammal and bird galleries. It also contains prehistoric artifacts such as the huge skeleton of a dinosaur . [ 22 ]\nAdministration\n[ edit ]\nAdministrative control of the Cultural sections, viz. Art, Archaeology and Anthropology rests with the Board of Trustees under its Directorate, and that of the three other science sections is with the geological survey of India, the zoological survey of India and the Botanical survey of India. The museum Directorate has eight co-ordinating service units: Education, preservation, publication, presentation, photography, medical, modelling and library. This multipurpose institution with multidisciplinary activities is being included as an Institute of national importance in the seventh schedule of the Constitution of India .

They steer with the help of their flexible flippers. When in shallow water, manatees use their flippers to walk, slowly placing one in front of the other. Like whales and dolphins, manatees are mammals . Although they live in water, they have to surface frequently to breathe air. While swimming, manatees take in air every three or four minutes. When they are resting, they can stay underwater for up to 15 minutes.\nManatees are gentle animals. They rarely fight, and they have no natural enemies.\nSubsisting on water plants and plants that grow at the water's edge, a manatee takes in up to 1 pound (0.5 kilogram) of food for every 10 pounds (5 kilograms) it weighs.\nCheck out where West Indian manatees live.\nNational Geographic Maps\nPlease be respectful of copyright.

They may not be right for everyone, since they require a lot of attention and care, but they are a very social bird and can become an excellent companion for the entire family.\nThe typical coloring of this species is bright lime green with blue tail feathers and yellow under the wings. These birds love to talk and enjoy a good challenge, which makes training a ton of fun.\nLearn more about the Indian ringneck parakeet, including their temperament and care needs.\nSpecies Overview\nCommon Names: Indian ringneck parakeet,\xa0Indian ringneck parrot,\xa0rose-ringed parakeet\nScientific Name:\nPsittacula krameri manillensis\nAdult Size: 16 inches in length including tail feathers and 4 ounces in weight for a medium-sized parrot\nLife Expectancy: 25 to 30 years; some instances up to 50 years\n2:00\nClick Play to Learn More About the Colorful Indian Ringneck Parakeet\nOrigin and History\nThe Indian ringneck parakeet is an Asiatic subspecies of the rose-ringed parakeet ( Psittacula krameri ). This is an Asiatic parrot originally from Ceylon. Now you can find them in many parts of Asia, notably India and Pakistan. They also live in the western and southern areas of Sudan and the Middle East.\nIn the wild, they live in lightly timbered areas, as well as farmed areas of the countryside.\xa0They travel in flocks of 100 or more birds, so they are used to having company.\nIndian\xa0ringneck\xa0parakeets have been kept in captivity from as early as 200 B.C . In\xa0India, they were regarded as sacred beings after religious leaders began to recognize their ability to mimic human language clearly. Highly regarded by wealthy Indian royals,\xa0ringneck parrots were kept in decorative cages and admired for their colors and charming dispositions.\nDuring the 1920s,\xa0aviculturists began breeding captive\xa0ringnecks, and, with the advent of different color mutations, the popularity of the bird started to explode. Now widely available in the pet trade, Indian\xa0ringneck parakeets continue to gain increasing popularity as pets. Their relatively small size and beautiful markings help to make the\xa0ringneck\xa0the right\xa0choice for many\xa0bird owners.\nTemperament\nAlthough the Indian ringneck has something of a reputation for being nippy and hard to train, it is mostly undeserved. Since they are so smart, ringnecks get bored very quickly and will often resort to chewing and other destructive behavior if they feel neglected.\nThey also go through a bluffing stage during adolescence that is difficult for some owners to manage. This stage comes with slight aggression, but the phase lasts only a few weeks or months.\nGenerally, ringnecks handled often and adequately cared for have sweet, charming personalities. Their voice is almost comical, as it is very high-pitched yet soft. You will also notice that they're great at alerting you to danger, a wild instinct that is accompanied by loud calls.\nThey do not have a reputation for being very affectionate, though females tend to form a stronger bond with people while males are more easy-going. They are generally a low-maintenance bird (if there is really such a thing). Despite their aloof personalities, they do require a lot of time and attention.\xa0\nSpeech and Vocalizations\nThe Indian ringneck is one of the best talking birds among the domestic species. They can typically start speaking between 8 months and 1 year old, and they can learn more than 200 words. The bird can range from an average speaking level to yelling or screeching, but they are more generally known for their intelligence and quick learning when it comes to speech.\nIn addition, these birds are great whistlers. They’re quite loud when they screech, though, so they may be unsuitable for people living in apartments.\nIndian Ringneck Parakeet Colors and Markings\nRingnecks are available in multiple shades, such as:\nBright yellow\nGreen\nBlue\nAlbino\nCinnamon\nLutino\nThough the color mutations are common, the typical coloring of this species is bright lime green with blue tail feathers and yellow under the wings.\nThey are known as a dimorphic species, meaning that colors and markings can determine a bird's sex. Males sport deep red beaks, black facial markings, and three bands of color around their necks. The black ring develops at about 18 months, and blue and pink rings appear by the time they reach 3 years old. Females, while still beautiful, lack the facial and collar bands, although some do display a slight darkening of color around their necks.\nAjith Kumar/Flickr/\xa0CC BY 2.0\nLeidy755/Getty Images\nNattrass/Getty Images\nCaring for the Indian Ringneck Parakeet\nWith adequate attention, handling, and love, an Indian ringneck parakeet can quickly become a beloved companion and family member. They enjoy learning new things and are exceptionally proficient with owners who want to challenge their intelligence. That's one reason they develop such large vocabularies and are great at bird tricks.\nIf you notice any aggressive behavior, it's best to avoid scolding as the bird can develop a lifetime fear of people. The best way to handle this bird is to ignore bad behavior and use positive reinforcement for good behavior. Also, these birds aren’t ideal for households with children because they’re sensitive to noise and can startle easily.\nThe cage for this bird needs to be larger than you might expect. It should accommodate their long tail and let the bird hop around and play when you're not around. Make sure the bar spacing isn't large enough for them to get stuck in or escape through; the ideal size is 1/2-inch to 5/8-inch spacing.\nClean the food and water bowl daily, perches and toys weekly, and the floor monthly. Once a year, plan on taking everything outside to be hosed down.\n12 Friendly Pet Bird Species\nCommon Health Problems\nWhile the Indian ringneck parakeet is generally known to be a healthy pet bird, they are prone to common diseases , such as:\nPsittacosis : This is also known as parrot fever, and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include puffy eyes, loss of appetite, nasal discharge, and abnormal droppings.\nPolyomavirus: This affecs young parrots , and it is fatal.\xa0\nAspergillosis : This is a fungal infection that affects the respiratory tract. Symptoms include coughing, difficulty breathing, lethargy, and tail bobbing.\nBacterial infections: Like other birds, Indian ringneck parakeets are at risk of a number of bacterial infections . They include chlamydiosis and avian mycobacteriosis.\nFeather plucking: If bored, left alone for too long, or depressed , this bird may turn to self-destructive behaviors such as feather plucking .\nTo keep your bird healthy, consult an avian veterinarian or a veterinarian who has expertise in exotic birds.\nDiet and Nutrition\nWild Indian ringnecks usually feast on a diet of fruits, vegetables , nuts, berries, and seeds. They also enjoy the nectar from flowers and the flowers themselves.\nWhile most vets agree that it is best for captive birds to eat a nutritionally balanced pelleted diet, a ringneck will appreciate a variety of fruits and vegetables in their diet. Leafy greens and vegetables are crucial for any companion parrot to maintain a nutritionally sound diet, and the Indian ringneck parakeet is no exception.\nThey can also eat some of the healthy cooked food you would eat, and are particularly fond of chicken, though beans, grains, and rice are also acceptable. Avocados, rhubarb, chocolate, and other common foods are toxic to birds, however, so be careful.\nSome ringneck owners find that their bird will sort out and leave behind pellets if they're mixed with seeds. These birds seem picky about eating pellets. If you find that to be the case, offer pellets and seeds separately and rotate them on a regular schedule. They usually come around to pellets.\nAs a rule of thumb, start off by offering your bird 1/4 cup of pellets and 1/4 cup of fruits and vegetables daily. Increase the amount as needed. Remove the uneaten foods to prevent spoilage.\nAs with all birds, food and water containers should be emptied, cleaned,\xa0and refilled daily to reduce the risk of bacterial growth and infection.\nAvocados, rhubarb, chocolate, and other common foods are toxic to birds, so be careful.\nThese 7 Birds Make the Best Pets for Kids\nExercise\nParakeets are very active birds. As with most other bird species, it is a good idea to have a safe area for the pet to play and stretch their wings out of their cage for at least 3 hours each day. Make sure all windows are closed when your bird is out of their cage, and supervise them to ensure they don’t get hurt.\nRingnecks also have powerful jaw muscles to maintain. It is wise to provide an array of chewable toys, perches, and cage accessories, so the bird is less likely to gnaw on something valuable or dangerous. This species enjoys puzzles and any complex toys you can find, which should help keep the bird busy as well.\nProviding a mister and a dish of water to bathe in will also keep your feathered friend very happy.\nThe Spruce / Kelly Leigh Miller\nPros of Indian Ringneck Parakeets\nSocial and friendly\nIntelligent and can speak up to 200 words\nHave a funny sounding voice\nCons of Indian Ringneck Parakeets\nCan be loud, so not well-suited for apartments\nCan be more dependent on their owners than other birds\nCan be picky about their food\nWhere to Adopt or Buy an Indian Ringneck Parakeet\nIndian ringnecks are relatively common in the United States and can be rescued, adopted, or purchased at verified organizations like RescueParrots.org or adoption websites like Petfinder. Pricing ranges from $400 to $500, though you can expect to pay up to $700 depending on the organization and the bird.\nIf you're going the breeder route, make sure that the breeder is reputable by asking them how long they've been breeding and working with Indian ringneck parakeets. Ask for a tour, but don't be alarmed if you are unable to tour the facilities in which they keep the birds. Many reputable breeders opt to work under closed aviaries, which prevents diseases from infecting the flock.\nAlso, make sure that the bird you want to take home is as healthy. Make sure the parakeet is alert, active, and exhibits all the\xa0signs of a healthy bird, such as bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops.\nMore Pet Bird Species and Further Research\nIf you’re interested in similar species, check out:\nBourke's Parakeet\nLineolated Parakeet\nPlum-Headed Parakeet\nOtherwise, check out all of our other small parrot\xa0 species profiles .\nFAQ\nAre Indian ringnecks good pets?\nFor the right pet parents, Indian ringnecks can make great companions, with their fun and social personality.

Typically shy and small, relative to other tortoises, they prefer natural sunlight and life outdoors but can adapt to indoor living with adequate heat, lighting, and humidity. Indian star tortoises are native to the arid climates in India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, and are accustomed to monsoon seasons. If their environment isn't right, they are prone to illness. These tortoises are pretty to look at, not big on handling, and are difficult pets to keep.\nSpecies Overview\nCommon Names : Star tortoise, Indian Star Tortoise,\nScientific Name : Geochelone elegans\nAdult Size : 7 to 12\xa0inches long\nLife Expectancy : Can live up to 80 years, though 30 to 55 years is more typical\nIndian Star Tortoise Behavior and Temperament\nUnlike some other tortoise species, star tortoises are not territorial. And, since they're small, you can house several of them together.\xa0They are not climbers.\nIndian star tortoises do not like being handled. They can get stressed out and get ill if handled frequently, so these animals should not live in homes with small children.\nAlthough these tortoises tend to be shy and do not like handling, they may grow more comfortable with an owner's occasional handling, especially when that owner brings them food.\xa0They rarely bite, but a nip may occur if the tortoise thinks a brightly colored toenail or fingernail is a flower petal.\nCare for this tortoise is not complicated, but there are many factors you must monitor and maintain daily. Expect to spend at least 45 minutes per day preparing meals, changing the water bowl, and spot cleaning the cage.\nHousing the Indian Star Tortoise\nEven though they are smaller than most other tortoises, Indian star tortoises still need their space. They can be housed indoors in a large fish tank (55-gallon) or a plastic container, like an under-the-bed box or storage container. They don't need much height in their enclosure.\nAnd, if you have other pets like cats or dogs, their cage will need to be completely enclosed, at least with a screen top, to protect them from other animals.\nOutdoor enclosures should be roughly 6 feet by 6 feet with walls that your tortoise cannot see over. Star tortoises typically don't dig, so you shouldn't have to worry about burying the walls in the ground as you would with other types of tortoises. When the tortoise is left unsupervised outdoors, make sure you have a secure covering to safeguard your pet from wild predators, such as birds, raccoons, and opossums.\nIf you do not live in a dry region similar to their natural habitat, it can be tough to replicate their environment. To complicate matters, the tortoises are accustomed to a heavy rainy season in their native home and will require humidity to thrive.\nHeat\nAs cold-blooded creatures, all reptiles need to regulate their body temperature . If you have an outdoor enclosure, the temperature needs to reach at least 90 degrees. Your tortoise needs a basking spot from 90 to 95 F. At night, the temperature can drop to the 70s, but no lower than that. The enclosure should also have shade spots and a water bowl for the tortoise to fully submerge (and climb out of) to control its temperature. Indoors, your pet's enclosure will need the same—a basking spot, a shady, hiding place, and a shallow container with clean, fresh water. The indoor enclosure is easier to control by adding or removing heat sources, such as light bulbs, ceramic heaters, and under tank heaters.\nLight\nThese tortoises prefer the outdoors and need ultraviolet rays provided by the sunlight. If kept indoors, tortoises need UVB lighting . UVB helps the tortoise process vitamin D3, which affects calcium absorption. Inadequate UV exposure can lead to metabolic bone disease.\nSome tortoise owners opt for a mercury vapor bulb, which is a combination UVB and heat light. Although, a 10 percent fluorescent UVB bulb works too. The UVB bulb should stay on for a 12-hour cycle. Replaced the bulb every six months. Even if the bulb doesn't burn out, the UV rays stop emitting by that time.\nHumidity\nProvide a moist hide box that reaches up to 80 percent relative humidity and an abundant water bowl with a graduated slope, making it easy for the tortoise to climb in and out. A substrate that maintains humidity like peat moss or soil can also help add moisture to your pet's enclosure. To accurately monitor the humidity levels, use a hygrometer or humidity gauge, and check the measurements daily.\nSubstrate\nThese tortoises need\xa0substrate or bedding lining the enclosure made of organic potting soil (chemical- and vermiculite-free), peat moss, coconut fiber, or even hay or grass. Although they are not known to be big diggers, females will shovel down into the substrate to make a shallow nest for eggs.\nHow to Care for a Pet Sulcata Tortoise\nFood and Water\nStar tortoises are herbivores. Give plenty of fresh and dark leafy greens and grasses. Timothy hay, Bermuda grass, orchard grass, ryegrass, alfalfa, and fescue are all acceptable. Never feed your Indian star tortoise dog or cat food.\nFresh greens suitable for tortoises include kale, endive, parsley, dandelion greens, escarole, spineless cactus leaves, and mustard greens; these greens have a higher calcium-to-phosphorus ratio, which is healthier for the star tortoise. Dust an additional calcium powder on their greens daily. Occasionally, you can offer a small bit of fruit as a treat.\nFeed it once daily at the same time every day from several food trays spread throughout the enclosure to replicate foraging. Give them as much food as they will eat within 15 to 30 minutes, or you can estimate the pile of food to offer as about the size of the animal's shell.\nChange and clean its water container daily and replenish it with filtered water, if available.\nCommon Health Problems\nPet tortoises raised in the wild are more likely to suffer from respiratory infections , but they're relatively common among captive tortoises as well. Respiratory infections usually are caused by unsanitary conditions or insufficient humidity. Early signs of a respiratory infection include wheezing and a lack of appetite. Still, a sick tortoise also may appear lethargic and have excess mucus around its mouth and nasal passages.\nStar tortoises, like most other turtles and tortoises, are susceptible to metabolic bone disease , which occurs when the animal isn't getting the proper balance of calcium and phosphorous. Tortoises and most other reptiles need exposure to ultraviolet radiation to be able to absorb calcium. Tortoises in the wild typically bask in the sun for most of their waking hours, which is how they get this UV exposure.\xa0\nIf a tortoise doesn't get enough calcium, its shell may not grow at an average rate. Older star tortoises with metabolic bone disease may have difficulty walking and suffer bone fractures.\xa0\nThese medical conditions are treatable by an\xa0 exotics veterinarian \xa0who specializes in reptiles. Be sure to follow your vet's directions for care and treatment.\nChoosing Your Indian Star Tortoise\nStar tortoises are long-lived pets that require a long-term commitment. Depending on when you get your pet and its age, it may outlive you. Some pet owners make arrangements for their pet tortoises in their wills.\nIf you are set on an Indian star tortoise, your best source will be a reputable breeder. For a local lead on a breeder, inquire at a nearby exotics veterinarian, ask your area reptile rescue, or meet breeders at a regional reptile expo.\nCaptive-bred animals are less likely to have parasitic infections, and a reputable breeder has information on their breeding, birthdate, and health history. You can expect to pay $600 to $3000; babies usually cost the least and breeding females can generally cost more.\nBefore bringing it home, examine the tortoise's shell . Tortoises with patchy dry spots on their shells are likely suffering from shell rot, caused by a fungal infection. If the tortoise seems lethargic or doesn't eat offered food, it may be ill. A healthy tortoise has clear eyes and skin, and its shell should be smooth and mostly free of blemishes.\xa0\n205 Names for Pet Turtles and Tortoises\nSimilar Species to the Indian Star Tortoise\nIf you're trying to decide which tortoise is the right pet for you, here are a few related species you may want to consider:\xa0\nSulcata Tortoise Species Profile\nHermann's Tortoise Species Profile\nGreek Tortoise Species Profile\nYou also can check out our profiles of other\xa0species of tortoises \xa0to find the right pet for you.\xa0\nArticle Sources\nThe Spruce Pets uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Nagarahole abounds with Bengal tigers and Indian leopards . Tourists flock to the reserve to catch a glimpse of these big cats, including an especially bold black panther —a leopard with a mutation that causes dark pigmentation. That cat, often sighted, has become something of a star.\n“Usually when you go on a safari, it’s like, Did you see a tiger?” says Krithi Karanth, a scientist at the Centre for Wildlife Studies in Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore). “Now it’s like, Oh, you saw a tiger. Great, but did you see the black panther?”\nLess than a 10th of the 327-square-mile park is open to visitors. At the southern end of this tourism zone lies the Kabini River, fringed with brush and tall grasses. Beyond are meadows and streams and dense woods. It’s the perfect milieu for tigers and leopards to coexist: tigers prowling in the undergrowth; leopards lounging in trees, safe from tigers.\nA tiger drinks from one of Nagarahole's water holes. Across the reserve, park authorities have installed solar-powered bore wells, which are activated when the water level drops, helping keep these essential water sources full throughout the year.\nThe likelihood of seeing these big cats has gone up significantly during the past decade in Nagarahole and many other wildlife reserves across India, thanks to the success of conservation efforts. The latest count of tigers at Nagarahole was 135, more than twice the number from a decade ago. The country now has almost 3,000 tigers in the wild, according to the latest official census , completed in 2018. That’s 33 percent higher than in 2014. The number of leopards has increased 62 percent since 2014, to nearly 13,000. \xa0\nOne sign of this growing population is more sightings of big cats beyond the edges of reserves, which also has increased the potential for conflict with humans. “I have tigers living around my house in central India,” says conservationist Belinda Wright, founder of the Wildlife Protection Society of India , who lives on the edge of Kanha Tiger Reserve in the state of Madhya Pradesh.\nThe rising numbers are particularly encouraging to conservationists because tiger and leopard counts are now more credible. Until 2006, India’s tiger census, conducted every four years, was more of a guesstimate based on a survey of paw prints—a lengthy and tedious exercise carried out by teams covering tens of thousands of square miles. The bulk of the counting is now done using images from camera traps that enable the identification of individual tigers and leopards by their unique patterns of stripes or spots.\nVijay Mohan Raj, chief conservator of forests in Karnataka, credits the success at Nagarahole and other reserves to more effective anti-poaching personnel strategically stationed inside the reserves. These frontline workers, Raj says, now are better trained and better equipped because of increased government funding that followed India’s commitment in 2010 to an international plan to double the number of tigers worldwide. “That’s been the biggest deterrent for anybody looking to enter the forest to poach for meat or even to collect firewood,” he says. “All such incursions stopped.”\nAs a result, the density of prey species such as deer and wild boar has gone up, helping their predators—tigers and leopards—to thrive. At Nagarahole the big cats also appear to have benefited from 26 solar-powered bore wells installed next to ponds, keeping them full even in the dry months.\nThe future of big cats in Nagarahole and similar reserves hinges in part on minimizing conflict between the animals and neighboring communities. In one village I visited just outside the park boundary, I watched kids rolling rubber tires along a mud track as the sun was setting over the Kabini. A cart trundled by, pulled by a pair of oxen, their bells jangling.\nA black panther heads toward a thicket with a just captured fawn. As Nagarahole has improved anti-poaching measures, herbivores such as spotted deer have become plentiful. With the rise in prey population, big cats have thrived.\nAs the competition for territory inside India’s reserves intensifies, tigers and leopards are wandering into such villages more often, killing cattle and sometimes humans. In Karnataka alone, at least nine people were killed by tigers from 2019 to 2021.\nEven though revenue from big cat tourism has been growing, Wright says, the money hasn’t helped local residents. “So they don’t feel they benefit from the presence of tigers,” she adds. Wildlife authorities do compensate people who lose cattle to tigers and have moved some villages away from tiger terrain, but they still need to do more to give surrounding communities a stake in the success of the reserves, conservationists say, or the gains made over the past decade could disappear.\nLearn more.

The males are called peacocks, while the females are called peahens. Together, they are peafowl.\nCommon Name :\nIndian Peafowl\nScientific Name :\nPavo cristatus\nType :\nBirds\nDiet :\nOmnivore\nGroup Name :\nParty\nAverage Life Span In The Wild :\n20 years\nSize :\nBody: 35 to 50 inches; tail: 5 feet\nWeight :\n8.75 to 13 pounds\nPeafowl are among the largest of all birds that fly. ( Ostriches , emus, and other such birds are bigger, but cannot fly.) The beautiful feathers that cover the tails of a peacock are 5 feet (1.5 meters) long—longer than the bird's body—and can be displayed in a spectacular fan of brilliant colors. These long feathers actually grow from the bird's back not the tail. He elevates them by raising the much shorter tail feathers underneath them.\nPeahens are more drab than their male counterparts, with mostly brown on their back with a white belly. Females don't have long tail feathers, but they do have a crest on their head and green neck feathers.\nIndian peafowl are native to India and Sri Lanka, in South Asia. They've been introduced to other countries, usually as exhibits in parks, zoos, and nature centers or as domestic pets. The head and body of adult peafowl range from 3 to 4 feet long and their tail can be 5 feet long.\nCheck out where Indian peafowls live.\nNational Geographic Maps\nPlease be respectful of copyright.

At first glance you’d be forgiven for thinking he was off his trolley. Not only is this not a wildlife reserve, it’s a region teeming with villagers and livestock—not the usual compadres of large predators.\nYet this pastoral region of just less than eight square miles in the Aravalli hills between the tourist meccas of Udaipur and Jodhpur contains the largest concentration of leopards on the planet. Some fifty leopards live here in rocky outcrops that rise amongst the irrigated fields and thorny desert scrub .\n“Visitors can’t believe it,” says Pratap, who runs a homestay for leopard-seeking tourists. “We have people coming who have spent years on safari in Africa and never seen a leopard, and within an hour or two of them arriving here, we’ve shown them a leopard, sometimes even two.”\nA leopard sits above an altar in Bera, where these big cats and humans live peacefully side-by-side.\nPhotograph by Shatrunjay Pratap\nThe leopards’ conspicuous presence is due to a unique relationship with the Rabari villagers. The Rabari , a tribal caste of semi-nomadic cattle herders and shepherds believed to have migrated to Rajasthan from Iran via Afghanistan a thousand years ago, are devout Hindus. In particular, they’re devotees of Shiva—the god of wild things, who’s clad in a leopard skin.\nThe continent of India is home to as many as 14,000 leopards , up from a historical low of 6,000 to 7,000 in the 1960s. Leopards , like all wildlife in India, are protected by law—a reflection, in theory at least, of the Hindu tenet of ahimsa , or non-violence. But as leopard numbers increase, human-leopard conflicts have also risen. Between 1995 and 2017, the nonprofit Wildlife Protection Society of India recorded 4,373 leopards killed . They were either poached for the illegal trade in body parts for medicines and aphrodisiacs or killed by farmers and villagers out of fear or retaliation for attacks on livestock.\nIn Bera, however, attitudes couldn’t be more different. When leopards occasionally vault into a livestock pen at night, dragging away a precious calf, goat or sheep, villagers are content to claim the modest recompense the State Forestry Department provides. They’ll get about $28 for a goat or sheep, $70 for a calf, and $280 for a bull or a camel—less than half the market price. Sometimes, they don’t even do this, considering the kill an offering to the god.\nLIMITED TIME OFFER\nDiscover More, Spend Less\nWith new subscriber-exclusive stories published daily and complete archive access, your opportunities to explore are endless!\nSAVE NOW\n“If any leopard kills my livestock, Lord Shiva will give me double,” says Kesa Ram, 27, a herdsman and part-time leopard tracker for tourists.\nMutual Understanding\nThe leopards, in turn, seem to consider humans no threat. While, elsewhere in India, some 90 to a hundred are killed and nearly a thousand people are injured by leopards every year. But despite the high concentration of leopards, there’ve been no attacks on people in Bera for over a century, apart from one unfortunate incident 20 years or so ago when a leopard snatched a one-year-old in Vellar village. The girl’s family, however, considers themselves to blame, having left her wrapped in a bundle out in the open, near the cattle shed, late in the evening. When they shouted, the leopard dropped the child and ran off.\nSantosh Kunwar Chauhan, now 24, and her family are undaunted by her brush with the predator, believing it even auspicious, the canine marks on her neck a talisman. She’s nicknamed Setri —the local word for a female leopard. Convinced the leopard made a genuine mistake, the villagers of Vellar still allow their children to play out in the open.\nClose to a village temple, a female leopard waits for nightfall, when she’ll seek out a feral dog, goat, or calf as prey. When a village loses livestock to a leopard, they see it as an offering to the god Shiva.\nPhotograph by Isabella Tree\nIt’s an astonishingly forgiving response in a country where poisoned meat is routinely left out for leopards and tigers that stray into farmland and villages. Many Rabari believe it is their dharma —their religious duty—to respect wildlife, feeding wild peacocks and langur monkeys at temples, for example.\nBut there’s a practical element too. The leopards’ presence is welcomed for keeping neelgai antelope, wild boar, and chinkara (Indian gazelles) away from crops of cotton, maize, wheat, mustard, and groundnut.\nYou May Also Like\nANIMALS\nLeopards are the ultimate survivors. Can they endure these growing challenges?\nHISTORY & CULTURE\nWho is Hanuman, the Hindu god with the face of a monkey?\nANIMALS\nThese invasive pests are tormenting Florida’s manatees\nWith livestock easy pickings, and a plentiful supply of stray dogs (the leopards’ standard fare), numbers of leopards are higher amongst the ten villages of Bera than on any wildlife reserve. One female recently raised a litter of four, thought to be a world record. Behavior is different, too. Leopards are generally loners, but in Bera it’s possible to see as many as five adult leopards together.\nA favorite leopard haunt is a cave adjoining a small temple set 30 feet up in the crevice of a rocky outcrop. The evening we visited, villagers were climbing the steps with offerings, unconcerned that a young male leopard was emerging from the shadows with his sister. Just as nonchalantly, the leopards padded across the mouth of the cave and flopped down on a lookout rock. Fully grown, yet still playful, they rubbed muzzles and swatted each other with soft paws. They seemed indifferent to our vehicle and two others from a neighboring camp that had joined us, but at 7:30 p.m. we backed off and left them to it. The curfew is self-imposed by the Rabari, who have a saying: “The day belongs to humans, but nights belong to the leopard.”\nLocal Businesses Versus Hotel Industry\nTourism is still low-key here and welcomed by villagers. Men are employed as trackers and alert hotels to leopard sightings. Women work in hotels as housekeepers, maids, and cooks, earning independent incomes for the first time. “With tourists coming to see the leopards, we women are starting to move out of our houses to work,” says Kesi Rabari, a 37-year-old housewife whose daughter works for Bera Safari Lodge . “Earlier our lives were just restricted to the fields.”\nBut word is getting out, and the big hotel industry is poised to move in. It’s a powerful economic force in India with strong connections to local government and the Forestry Department. Concerned about the impact on the landscape and their culture, the Rabari villages, aided by Pratap, are campaigning to have Bera designated a “community reserve,” only the second in India. It would ensure regulation—and income—remains in the hands of villagers.\nA tourist watches a male leopard on the rocks nearby. Villages in Bera are seeking recognition as a community reserve so that they can maintain local control over the tourism sector, but already big hotel businesses are trying to move in.\nPhotograph by Isabella Tree\n“At the moment,” says Pratap, “You can expect to see maximum four or five tourist jeeps at a leopard sighting. It’s sustainable. But if we don’t get community reserve status, this site will go crazy. We’ll be overrun by overlanders and safari trucks charging in from every direction. Already, every year, three or four new hotels are built, and at the moment there’s no restriction where they build them. Obviously the sites they go for are the most scenic—the rocks where the leopards live.”\nUnder community reserve law, development within the area would be prohibited. The villagers would have the power to dictate the number and size of hotels serving the reserve and the number of jeeps allowed on safari at any one time. They would be able to enforce a nighttime curfew for leopard-watching and—crucially—ensure that locals continue to benefit from the jobs arising from tourism.\nA pressing concern is that big hotels will import their own guides and staff. Marginalization of local people, Pratap argues, is where the national and state parks of India go wrong. Without the direct involvement of local communities acting as wildlife protectors, poaching, particularly of tigers and leopards, is rife.\nAs yet, though, the villagers’ petition for community reserve status to the chief minister of the government of Rajasthan, submitted in 2015, has been met with silence. According to Pratap, big hoteliers have been putting pressure on local government to “put the file to rest” and are trying to convince villagers that it’s in their interest to work with the industry rather than push for their own reserve. Almost all 21 villages in Bera had originally petitioned for the community reserve, but several villages have changed their minds. The longer the file sits unanswered in local government offices, the harder it will be to get a community reserve off the ground, Pratap believes.\n“When we are demonstrating how well we can do as guardians of the leopards,” says Pratap, “why can’t we keep this place in the hands of the community, as an example to the world about co-existence?”\nRelated Topics\nLEOPARDS\nHINDUISM\nECOTOURISM\nYou May Also Like\nTRAVEL\n20 of the coolest travel adventures for 2024\nANIMALS\nThey’re destructive, there are 5 million of them—and they’re sacred\nANIMALS\nThe surprisingly fraught fight for a pet cat in Antarctica\nANIMALS\nScientists finally know the clever tricks orca use to hunt whale sharks\nANIMALS\nThis unnerving photo reminds us why we shouldn’t feed bears\nLegal\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nYour US State Privacy Rights\nChildren's Online Privacy Policy\nInterest-Based Ads\nAbout Nielsen Measurement\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nOur Sites\nNat Geo Home\nAttend a Live Event\nBook a Trip\nBuy Maps\nInspire Your Kids\nShop Nat Geo\nVisit the D.C.

They would be able to enforce a nighttime curfew for leopard-watching and—crucially—ensure that locals continue to benefit from the jobs arising from tourism.\nA pressing concern is that big hotels will import their own guides and staff. Marginalization of local people, Pratap argues, is where the national and state parks of India go wrong. Without the direct involvement of local communities acting as wildlife protectors, poaching, particularly of tigers and leopards, is rife.\nAs yet, though, the villagers’ petition for community reserve status to the chief minister of the government of Rajasthan, submitted in 2015, has been met with silence. According to Pratap, big hoteliers have been putting pressure on local government to “put the file to rest” and are trying to convince villagers that it’s in their interest to work with the industry rather than push for their own reserve. Almost all 21 villages in Bera had originally petitioned for the community reserve, but several villages have changed their minds. The longer the file sits unanswered in local government offices, the harder it will be to get a community reserve off the ground, Pratap believes.\n“When we are demonstrating how well we can do as guardians of the leopards,” says Pratap, “why can’t we keep this place in the hands of the community, as an example to the world about co-existence?”\nRelated Topics\nLEOPARDS\nHINDUISM\nECOTOURISM\nYou May Also Like\nTRAVEL\n20 of the coolest travel adventures for 2024\nANIMALS\nThey’re destructive, there are 5 million of them—and they’re sacred\nANIMALS\nThe surprisingly fraught fight for a pet cat in Antarctica\nANIMALS\nScientists finally know the clever tricks orca use to hunt whale sharks\nANIMALS\nThis unnerving photo reminds us why we shouldn’t feed bears\nLegal\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nYour US State Privacy Rights\nChildren's Online Privacy Policy\nInterest-Based Ads\nAbout Nielsen Measurement\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nOur Sites\nNat Geo Home\nAttend a Live Event\nBook a Trip\nBuy Maps\nInspire Your Kids\nShop Nat Geo\nVisit the D.C.

Black panthers are leopards with a genetic mutation that causes the dark pigmentation of their coats. The rosette patterns are still visible against their fur.\nBy Yudhijit Bhattacharjee\nPhotographs by Shaaz Jung\nFebruary 10, 2022\n• 9 min read\nDraped in mist, the lush, forested landscape of Nagarahole Tiger Reserve in India’s southwestern Karnataka state looks enchanted.\nAn elephant lumbers through the foliage, feeding on shrubs and leaves, its gigantic ears flapping as if to the beat of a metronome. Up ahead along the dirt road, bison-like gaur graze in a meadow, not so much as glancing in our direction.\nGuided by photographer Shaaz Jung, who has lived in a lodge in the forest for the past 12 years, we drive on, stopping by a herd of spotted deer. An iridescent blue kingfisher flits between the trees. As sunlight cuts through the haze, the tranquility is broken by the bark of a deer ringing out in the distance. It’s an alarm, warning that a predator lurks nearby.\nLeopards court in a flowering coral tree on a misty winter morning at Nagarahole Tiger Reserve. The two are likely to mate several times while they are together, which can be for up to a week.\nWhen the waters of the Kabini River recede during the summer months, the surrounding area transforms into a grassland where spotted deer and other animals come to graze. The landscape offers an abundance of prey for big cats.\nNagarahole is the perfect place for tigers and leopards to coexist: tigers prowling in the undergrowth, leopards lounging in trees.\nCalls like this are heard here with increasing frequency. Nagarahole abounds with Bengal tigers and Indian leopards . Tourists flock to the reserve to catch a glimpse of these big cats, including an especially bold black panther —a leopard with a mutation that causes dark pigmentation. That cat, often sighted, has become something of a star.\n“Usually when you go on a safari, it’s like, Did you see a tiger?” says Krithi Karanth, a scientist at the Centre for Wildlife Studies in Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore). “Now it’s like, Oh, you saw a tiger. Great, but did you see the black panther?”\nLess than a 10th of the 327-square-mile park is open to visitors. At the southern end of this tourism zone lies the Kabini River, fringed with brush and tall grasses. Beyond are meadows and streams and dense woods. It’s the perfect milieu for tigers and leopards to coexist: tigers prowling in the undergrowth; leopards lounging in trees, safe from tigers.\nA tiger drinks from one of Nagarahole's water holes. Across the reserve, park authorities have installed solar-powered bore wells, which are activated when the water level drops, helping keep these essential water sources full throughout the year.\nThe likelihood of seeing these big cats has gone up significantly during the past decade in Nagarahole and many other wildlife reserves across India, thanks to the success of conservation efforts. The latest count of tigers at Nagarahole was 135, more than twice the number from a decade ago. The country now has almost 3,000 tigers in the wild, according to the latest official census , completed in 2018. That’s 33 percent higher than in 2014. The number of leopards has increased 62 percent since 2014, to nearly 13,000. \xa0\nOne sign of this growing population is more sightings of big cats beyond the edges of reserves, which also has increased the potential for conflict with humans. “I have tigers living around my house in central India,” says conservationist Belinda Wright, founder of the Wildlife Protection Society of India , who lives on the edge of Kanha Tiger Reserve in the state of Madhya Pradesh.\nThe rising numbers are particularly encouraging to conservationists because tiger and leopard counts are now more credible. Until 2006, India’s tiger census, conducted every four years, was more of a guesstimate based on a survey of paw prints—a lengthy and tedious exercise carried out by teams covering tens of thousands of square miles. The bulk of the counting is now done using images from camera traps that enable the identification of individual tigers and leopards by their unique patterns of stripes or spots.\nVijay Mohan Raj, chief conservator of forests in Karnataka, credits the success at Nagarahole and other reserves to more effective anti-poaching personnel strategically stationed inside the reserves. These frontline workers, Raj says, now are better trained and better equipped because of increased government funding that followed India’s commitment in 2010 to an international plan to double the number of tigers worldwide. “That’s been the biggest deterrent for anybody looking to enter the forest to poach for meat or even to collect firewood,” he says. “All such incursions stopped.”\nAs a result, the density of prey species such as deer and wild boar has gone up, helping their predators—tigers and leopards—to thrive. At Nagarahole the big cats also appear to have benefited from 26 solar-powered bore wells installed next to ponds, keeping them full even in the dry months.\nThe future of big cats in Nagarahole and similar reserves hinges in part on minimizing conflict between the animals and neighboring communities. In one village I visited just outside the park boundary, I watched kids rolling rubber tires along a mud track as the sun was setting over the Kabini. A cart trundled by, pulled by a pair of oxen, their bells jangling.\nA black panther heads toward a thicket with a just captured fawn. As Nagarahole has improved anti-poaching measures, herbivores such as spotted deer have become plentiful. With the rise in prey population, big cats have thrived.\nAs the competition for territory inside India’s reserves intensifies, tigers and leopards are wandering into such villages more often, killing cattle and sometimes humans. In Karnataka alone, at least nine people were killed by tigers from 2019 to 2021.\nEven though revenue from big cat tourism has been growing, Wright says, the money hasn’t helped local residents. “So they don’t feel they benefit from the presence of tigers,” she adds. Wildlife authorities do compensate people who lose cattle to tigers and have moved some villages away from tiger terrain, but they still need to do more to give surrounding communities a stake in the success of the reserves, conservationists say, or the gains made over the past decade could disappear.\nLearn more.

Can they endure these growing challenges?\nThese cats face a plethora of threats from shrinking habitat, diminishing prey, conflict with humans, poaching, and more. But a new report describes isolated success stories that show population declines can be reversed.\nAll eight leopard subspecies are threatened across their Asian and African range, according to a new updated assessment. Here, a leopard stalks through the tall grasses of Botswana\'s Okavango Delta at twilight.\nPhotograph By Beverly Joubert, National Geographic\nBy Sharon Guynup\nJuly 4, 2024\nThe state of the world’s leopards inspires hope, with some of the eight subspecies stabilizing or slightly rebounding. But the serious peril of others is causing alarm, according to a new assessment by the world’s leading scientific authority on global extinction.\nThough leopards are the most resilient big cat, they have declined by more than 30 percent over the last 22 years—which is three generations. They have disappeared from entire swathes of their historic range and may now be extinct in 26 countries that they formerly roamed. These findings, released on June 27 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), are part of an update to its Red List of Threatened Species . \xa0\nThis new Red List leopard assessment documented rapid declines in West, Central, and East Africa. Here, leopards climb a tree in Kenya’s Masai Mara National Reserve.\nPhotograph By Beverly Joubert, National Geographic Image collection\nIUCN lists leopards as “ Vulnerable ,” a category given to species facing a high extinction risk due rapid population declines or other factors. But some subspecies are in critical condition. \xa0\nLeopards inhabit 62 nations across Africa and Asia, from Senegal’s Atlantic coastline to eastern Siberia. These cats live in every imaginable landscape, from sea level to 17,000 feet: forest, mountains, savanna, desert, jungle, and even Sanjay Gandhi National Park in the center of Mumbai , a city of 21 million people. It’s the widest geographic range of any big cat.\nThese iconic felids face urgent threats to their survival regardless of where they live. The assessment notes that their numbers have “dramatically reduced due to continued persecution from increased human populations.”\nBecause leopards are adaptable and secretive, living in places that most wild cats won’t, it’s difficult to evaluate their status.\nLIMITED TIME OFFER\nDiscover More, Spend Less\nWith new subscriber-exclusive stories published daily and complete archive access, your opportunities to explore are endless!\nSAVE NOW\n“People just assume that they\'re doing well, but the evidence shows that throughout most of their range, they are not,” says Andrew Stein, a leopard expert who headed both this analysis and the previous one in 2016.\nThis new leopard report mirrors a mostly grim trajectory for big cats worldwide. \xa0 It’s also bad news for many animals they live beside. With few apex predators, changes cascade throughout increasingly unbalanced ecosystems.\nBut scientists emphasize that informed, targeted conservation works. The Indian leopard is one example: with greater attention, it was downlisted from Vulnerable to Near Threatened.\nMixed news\nThis Red List update also evaluated individual subspecies. The results are as different as the locales the cats inhabit.\nThe Near Threatened Indian leopard is doing comparatively well, with a population of 15,000-plus—the result of increased research and better management. The Sri Lankan leopard is Vulnerable; 777 remain. \xa0\nAfrican leopards are also in the Vulnerable category—and rapidly disappearing. However, we don’t know how many mature individuals or healthy breeding populations there are, says Marine Drouilly, a wild cat biologist with the nonprofit Panthera. In some places, it’s unknown if any are left.\nThe Javan leopard, downlisted from Critically Endangered to Endangered, is still highly imperiled with just 319 remaining. As an island species, there’s little room to expand, so their future depends on management. Over the past five years, they’ve received significant attention, with progress forged in collaborations between governments, conservation groups, leopard scientists, and local communities, says Hariyo (Beebach) Wibisono, a member of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group.\nFour subspecies are Critically Endangered, one step from extinction.\nThe assessment flagged serious concern for the Indochinese leopard. Stein explained why. They are heavily poached, their habitat largely destroyed, and they hang on in empty scraps of forest devoid of prey in four Southeast Asian nations. Stein warned that “we could very easily watch this cat disappear between now and the next assessment. Ten, 15 years ago that would have been unthinkable.”\nThe Arabian leopard, the smallest subspecies, is also in dire straits: only 70 to 84 mature cats survive. It’s extinct in Saudi Arabia, but the country invested millions in 2019 to bring it back. Breeding and introducing captive-bred cats to the wild is difficult, but recent successes with Iberian lynx and Persian leopards show it’s possible.\nThe IUCN merged the Amur leopard with the North China subspecies, a decision based on genetic analysis. The Amur leopard has seen dramatic recovery. Protecting habitat and reintroducing deer and wild boar pulled this cat from the brink of extinction.\nLeopards are the most adaptable big cat, surviving anywhere from deserts to jungles to high mountain peaks—and even urban landscapes. This cat\xa0\xa0prowls the edge of India\'s Sanjay Gandhi\xa0National Park in the midst of Mumbai, home to 21 million people.\nPhotograph By Steve Winter\n“In the 2000s, we estimated that between 25 and 35 individuals remained,” says Dale Miquelle, a big cat expert with the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. But they have rebounded. By 2022, more than 100 adult leopards roamed Russia, plus a developing population in China, though it’s not yet a viable population, he says.\nYou May Also Like\nANIMALS\nWhy are orcas ramming boats?

While the population is fragile, \xa0 there’s hope, says Arash Ghoddousi, a conservation scientist and member of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group.\nThis cat is the best documented of any subspecies because of a joint initiative by IUCN and Convention on Migratory Species to gather information from experts across its range, from Turkey to the Caucuses. “It set the gold standard for regional work,” Ghoddousi says.\nThis says a lot about what can happen when people from different regions share a commitment to conservation, Stein notes. “It can lead to collaborations that you never would have thought possible.”\nThe threats endangering the leopards’ future \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\nThis assessment shows why there are no blanket statements for leopards. Their status, threats, and level of protection vary widely, and much remains unknown.\nTrying to understand the prevalence and whereabouts of a species across two continents requires on-the-ground surveys, mapping, and computer models. But with a nearly three-million-square-mile range, large areas have never been surveyed.\nShrinking habitat, along with diminishing prey and conflict with people, pose the top threats to leopards’ long-term survival, as well as escalating climate change and mushrooming human population.\nThe scale and speed of habitat loss in many regions is startling.\n“We suspect that suitable leopard range has been reduced by more than 30 percent worldwide over its last three generations,” the assessment authors wrote. Leopards lost 11 percent of their confirmed homelands during the past eight years.\nAfrica took the largest hit. “Crop fields and towns are replacing forests and savannas,” says Drouilly. The assessment noted that human populations will likely double in sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, requiring more land.\nBut with leopards, there are always exceptions. Territory expanded in India, and the breeding range of leopards in the Russian Far East and Northeast China doubled over two decades. \xa0\nCats need to move to find food, water, a mate, or to establish territory. Human incursions fragment the landscape, isolating populations. This lack of connectivity poses a major threat to African leopards, Drouilly says. Without wildlife corridors and an influx of new genes from neighboring populations, inbreeding creates a questionable future.\nIt’s already occurring, says Miquelle. “Amur leopards are showing signs of inbreeding, [like] white paws and shortened, kinked tails."\nFarms, ranches, and urban sprawl displace leopards and brings them into dangerous proximity to humans. They are exterminated wherever their range overlaps with ranchers and herders. Commercial bushmeat hunting is decimating their prey; hungry cats then kill livestock and owners retaliate.\nThe international trade in the cat’s spotted pelts, teeth, bones, and claws puts them in the crosshairs. This Red List assessment estimates that poachers can get up to $3,000 for a carcass—and illegal trade of skins and body parts used in cultural and spiritual rituals is rising in Africa.\nBut leopards face a plethora of threats, from mines, roads, civil unrest and armed conflict to logging, railroads, wildfire, poorly managed trophy hunting, and more.\nStein calls leopards “the ultimate survivors.” They’re agile, strong, highly intelligent; able to camouflage into the shadows; can live anywhere; feed on anything; and live close to people or in remote places. “The fact that we\'re losing them tells \xa0 us a lot about the broader challenges we are facing in the world.”\nThis assessment emphasizes the fact that leopards clearly need more attention to stop their decline and offers a powerful tool to inform decisions and catalyze action to save them.\nRelated Topics\nLEOPARDS\nAMUR LEOPARDS\nSNOW LEOPARDS\nCLOUDED LEOPARD\nBIG CATS\nPOACHING\nDEFORESTATION\nHUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICT\nWILDLIFE MANAGEMENT\nWILDLIFE CONSERVATION\nYou May Also Like\nENVIRONMENT\nA Yellowstone for Europe?

Can we do the same?\nBy Richard Conniff\nPhotographs by Steve Winter\n25 min read\nThis story appears in the December 2015 issue of National Geographic magazine.\nWe were sitting in the dark, waiting for the leopards beside a trail on the edge of India’s Sanjay Gandhi National Park, 40 square miles of green life in the middle of the sprawling gray metropolis of Mumbai. A line of tall apartment buildings stood just opposite, crowding the park border. It was 10 p.m., and through the open windows came the sounds of dishes being cleaned and children being put to bed. Religious music floated up from a temple in the distance. Teenage laughter, a motorcycle revving. The hum and clatter of 21 million people, like a great machine. Somewhere in the brush around us, the leopards were listening too, waiting for the noise to die down. Watching.\nAbout 35 leopards live in and around this park. That’s an average of less than two square miles of habitat apiece, for animals that can easily range ten miles in a day. These leopards also live surrounded by some of the world’s most crowded urban neighborhoods, housing 52,000 people or more per square mile. (That’s nearly twice the population density of New York City.) And yet the leopards thrive. Part of their diet comes from spotted deer and other wild prey within the park. But many of the leopards also work the unfenced border between nature and civilization. While the city sleeps, they slip through the streets and alleys below, where they pick off dogs, cats, pigs, rats, chickens, and goats, the camp followers of human civilization. They eat people too, though rarely.\nThey are fearful of people, and with good reason. Humans make fickle companions, admiring, rescuing, and even revering leopards in some contexts, and reviling them in many others—shooting them, snaring them, poisoning them, hanging them, even dousing a trapped leopard with kerosene, striking a match, and calmly filming as the animal writhes and whirls in a ball of fire, dying, but not nearly fast enough. Conservationists call leopards the world’s most persecuted big cat.\nDemand for the costly pelts worn in Christian-Zulu rituals like this one performed near Durban, South Africa, drives poaching. Panthera , a conservation group, promotes faux furs to help protect the wild cats.\nAnd yet leopards have become our shadows, our quasi-companion animals. They have no choice. The two great leopard population centers, sub-Saharan Africa and the subcontinent of India, are among the most populous regions in the world. Human expansion has already cost leopards an estimated 66 percent of their range in Africa and 85 percent in Eurasia, with most of the loss occurring over the past five decades. In many areas the only place left to survive is side by side with humans.\nUnlike most other big cats, leopards can adapt, up to a point. They can prey, for example, on anything from dung beetles and porcupines to a 2,000-pound eland. They can make a home at 110 degrees Fahrenheit in the Kalahari Desert or at minus 13 degrees in Russia. They can thrive in sea-level mangrove swamps on the coast of India or at 17,000 feet in the Himalaya. That adaptability, combined with a genius for hiding in plain sight, means leopards are entirely capable of living among humans, as they do in Mumbai. The question is whether humans can learn to live with leopards.\nWe have a long and complicated relationship , and like much else, it began in Africa. Leopards are a young species: They emerged in their modern form as recently as 500,000 years ago. Like us, they spread out to populate a large chunk of the globe, from the southern tip of Africa to the Russian Far East, as well as west into Senegal and southeast to Indonesia. They may have shadowed early humans, to take advantage of our ability to drive off lions and other competitors or, later, to pick off our livestock. We may have shadowed them to scavenge on their kills. (They are more vulnerable than other carnivores to scavenging because of their practice of stashing a kill under a bush or up a tree, then wandering off a short distance to rest, returning later to eat.)\nBy their predatory behavior , leopards imprinted themselves on the genomes of our fellow primates: Even monkeys that have never seen a leopard nonetheless display an instantaneous and heightened attentiveness to that spotted yellow coat. And so do we, with a curious mix of alarm and attraction. Our ambivalence is evident in the jarring mix of headlines that turn up in any news search for the word “leopard.” There’s often something warm (“ Newborn Leopard Cubs Make History, Melt Your Heart ”), something violent (“ Another Leopard Attack in Junnar ”), and something fashionably titillating (“ Gisele Bündchen Rocks Leopard-Print Bikini in Costa Rica ”). Often the headlines also speak of anger and vengeance.\nOne day in South Africa’s Limpopo Province I visited a cattle rancher, a big, friendly man in his 60s, dressed Boy Scout style in a short-sleeved shirt, green shorts, and green socks, rolled down an inch or two from the knees. He had a King James Bible open on his desk, heavily highlighted, and the skull of a leopard displayed on an end table. The skull had a small, precise bullet hole in it.\nA female leopard in South Africa’s Sabi Sand Reserve hauled a kill up a tree for safekeeping. The cats prefer medium-size prey like antelope and monkeys but can take animals many times their size.\n“We are very fond of these animals,” he began. “It’s a beautiful animal! But it’s difficult to be on the same land with them. We have lots of natural prey for them—warthogs, baboons , wild pigs, natural prey.” And yet the leopards insisted on taking his calves.\nHe opened the studbook in which he registers births and deaths of his Brahman cattle, a prized breed, and began to recite killings—one every six weeks or so over the previous 18 months. His farmworkers learn of a death on morning rounds, when a cow urgently informs them of her loss, and of her need for milking. Later she leads them “straight to where the calf is, half eaten or up a tree.” The rancher estimated his loss for each calf at more than $2,000. “We have very experienced trackers, and they’ll say if the leopard is a young female or an older male. Usually the leopard will come back for two days.”\nThe use of trackers—plus that skull on the end table—suggested someone waiting with a rifle to kill the attacker. But the rancher said only, “You live with them, and you keep quiet about them, because if you do anything about them, you are liable to be arrested and put in jail.” (South African law permits both jail time and a fine, but sentences are almost always lenient.) Other people kill “hundreds of them every year,” he said. “They’re shot, stuck in a hole, you put petrol on it, put a match in, and that’s it.”\nSome leopard pelts also end up being sold into a trade that is driven to a surprising extent by the worship of God.\nOn a brilliant Sunday in July , in the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, thousands of religious devotees were making their barefoot pilgrimage to a sacred hilltop, to the blaring of trumpets and the slow thumping of two-liter soda bottles beating bass drums. The single women marched with beaded straps across their bare breasts. The married women, cloaked in black, lifted their black umbrellas in time with the horns. But the men were the real spectacle. By rough count, 1,200 of them passed by with the skins of leopards draped across their shoulders, and in bands around their foreheads, biceps, waists, and ankles.\nOn the grassy field the men began to dance in unison to the droning music. They looked like a Zulu battle line and moved as if stalking prey, crouching a little, stepping slowly forward, then shooting one leg up and stomping it down, raising a line of dust clouds. For the Nazareth Baptist (or “Shembe”) Church, a century-old Christian denomination built on Zulu tradition, the dance is a form of worship and of meditation. Costumes matter too. In the past Zulu royalty wore leopard skins to symbolize power and enthrall their subjects. The Shembe men—accountants, lawyers, bureaucrats, and tradesmen—say that the leopard skins bring them closer to God and to their ancestors.\nForest guards grapple with the chaos of a leopard attack in West Bengal, India, in July 2012. The cat mauled six people before it was subdued.\nPHOTOGRAPH BY AFP/GETTY IMAGES\nCat conservationists, on the other hand, were horrified a few years ago when they stumbled on the festival. One of them called it “the biggest display of illegal wildlife contraband on Earth.” The sheer number of skins was bad enough in a country with a dwindling leopard population, estimated at fewer than 7,000 animals. But the skins also need to be replaced regularly, every five or six years, as they become brittle and curled with use. With a growing church membership attending multiple events each year, extinction of the species would be the only real limit on demand.\nFor leopard researcher Tristan Dickerson of the conservation group Panthera, the one hopeful sign at the first pilgrimage he attended was the presence of fakes in the crowd, mostly impala skins ineptly painted with leopard spots. It gave him the idea of making a better fake. He developed a design using a vinyl base and a pile fabric, with the colors matched to a real pelt.\n“I’m going for the fake-Rolex effect,” Dickerson said. Shembe leaders supported the plan, and a local workshop now produces the fakes under the “ Furs for Life ” brand. Panthera has distributed 9,000 of them free to church members and can barely keep up with demand.\nLEFT: Residents of Mumbai stroll paths also stalked by leopards. RIGHT: Gathering in numbers, and in brightly lit spots, helps residents feel safer outdoors after dark.\nOn the Sunday when I visited, only a single real skin was openly for sale. The price was $390 for a cape made from the leopard’s front half, and $425 for the back, serious money in a country where the per capita income is less than $13,000. One man complained that the fakes were a way for white people to thwart Zulu tradition. Another quibbled that a fake based on impala or other animal skins would be more acceptable to the ancestors than vinyl. Even so, most people seemed to want to get their hands on a fake skin. Dickerson calculated that 30 to 40 percent of leopard skins at Shembe gatherings are now Panthera fakes, up from 5 to 10 percent two years ago. It wasn’t necessarily a victory for love, or even tolerance, of leopards. But it was one less reason to kill them.\n2:32\nIndia may be the real test of survival in a crowded world—and perhaps a model for it—because leopards live there in large numbers, outside protected areas, and in astonishing proximity to people. Tolerance of leopards is also generally high, though India (and the British hunter and author Jim Corbett) largely established the term “man-eating leopard” in our vocabulary. It’s a misnomer: Women and children are the usual victims when leopards attack; size makes men more challenging. Because attacks often occur when people go into the brush to relieve themselves, men also gain an inadvertent survival advantage from being able to urinate while standing.\nIn any case, attacks on humans are relatively rare. It is far easier to die in India from civilization than from wildness: Nationwide 381 people are killed every day in road accidents, 80 more on rail lines, and 24 by electrocution. But leopard killings get headlines, partly because they are uncommon and also because they touch something primitive in the human psyche.\nLate on a Saturday morning in May, in the Junnar countryside, 95 miles east of Mumbai, a government car pulled up at a prosperous-looking little farmhouse. The occasion was horrific and yet polite. On the large veranda in front, surrounded by a waist-high concrete wall and shaded by a metal roof, a crowd waited for the man from the forest department.\nSix days earlier, at about 10:30 on a Sunday night, a two-year-old named Sai Mandlik was kneeling on a bench on this veranda and running a toy bus along the top of the wall. His grandmother relaxed on a daybed beside him. In the tall grass 20 or 30 yards away, a leopard spotted something: a head moving back and forth, not much larger than the bonnet macaques that are among its natural prey. It began to stalk. If he was lucky, the boy never saw the leopard that snatched him over the wall and carried him away through the fields. His grandmother screamed. The rest of the family came pouring out into the night. They were too late.\nWildlife officials found this leopard caught in a snare trap near northern India’s Corbett National Park. Clashes between people and wildlife are hard to prevent in a country where 703 protected areas share the land with 1.3 billion people.\nNow the tragedy was being reduced to ritual. The women sat silently on the floor at the far end of the porch. Local officials, old men in white Gandhi caps, sat in mid-porch, and at the other end of the porch, the father sat on the spot where his son had been taken, with male family and friends huddled around him. The forest official introduced himself (“I am also from a rural area; I am not somebody coming in from above”) and explained that he did not mean the compensation payment, about $12,300, as a substitute for their loss but as an acknowledgment from the government, which is responsible for the leopards. One of the local officials came to inspect the check, and they engaged in a cordial dance, with each of them saying the other should present it.\nYou May Also Like\nANIMALS\nLeopards are the ultimate survivors.

Four miles down the road there was another house to visit with much the same story. When such leopard attacks occur, they tend to come in terrifying waves. Sai Mandlik’s death was the third attack in the Junnar area in just over two weeks, and the second fatality.\nIt’s a puzzle: Much of the time, even in Mumbai, leopards and humans coexist peacefully. So why do sudden violent outbreaks occur in an area such as Junnar? The morning after the presentation at the Mandlik house Vidya Athreya, a biologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society, sat beside a sugarcane field in the nearby town of Akole. On her laptop computer a map of the community was lit up in great turquoise splotches representing all the places she found leopards during her five-year study here, using camera traps and radio collars. In short, she found them everywhere, 11 adults roaming by night in and around Akole, an area with no forests and no deer or other big, natural prey and where 20,000 people move around by day.\nA cub just six to seven months old roams along the fence that separates the leopards of South Africa’s Sabi Sand game reserve from villages and land where livestock graze.\nThe first question was, Why so many leopards? As elsewhere in India, it begins with reliance on open trash and meat market dumps, which support a thriving community of stray dogs, feral pigs, and other small animals. Federal law and an influential animal-rights movement prevent removal of street dogs. So the dogs and other domestic animals in turn support a thriving community of leopards. (They made up 87 percent of the leopards’ diet in Athreya’s study .)\nIrrigation schemes introduced since the 1980s also help attract leopards. Among other crops, sugarcane is now common in formerly dry areas such as Akole and the Junnar region, and this tall, thick grass provides a perfect hiding place for leopards—close to villages, garbage heaps, and dogs. It is an ecosystem.\nOne day during her research , Athreya said, she passed by a field where 15 women were picking tomatoes, and stopped to chat with a farmer. Oh, yes, the man said, he’d seen a leopard only a few days before. She didn’t tell him that a leopard was resting in the sugarcane at that moment, just 65 feet away. They had no cause for concern. “Leopards are not as bloodthirsty as we think,” said Athreya. “They are reasonable at some level.” Anthropologist Sunetro Ghosal, who has also worked in Akole, described “a history of sharing space” and even “mutual accommodation,” leopards and humans alike going out of their way to avoid confrontations. (Possibly as a form of insurance, people in the region treat leopards and tigers as gods, or waghobas , and make propitiatory offerings at small waghoba shrines.)\nA camera trap set in South Africa’s Cederberg Wilderness records the steady gaze of a Cape leopard cub.

In what seemed at first to be a coincidence, the forest department had been trapping leopards, more than a hundred of them, from problem areas in Junnar, mainly after attacks on livestock. Those animals got released in forests an average of 20 miles from the capture sites—a common technique for dealing with problem carnivores worldwide. But after the relocations, Athreya and her team discovered, attacks on humans in Junnar increased by 325 percent, and the percentage of those attacks that were fatal doubled.\n“It was a typical case of the messed-up mind of a cat,” Athreya said. Messed up, that is, by the trauma of being caught in a box trap, handled by humans, and dumped in an unfamiliar landscape and in territories already occupied by other leopards. The outbreak of attacks wasn’t, after all, a result of the leopards’ innate ferocity, according to Athreya and her co-authors: “Translocation induced attacks on people.”\nForest department managers generally got the message when Athreya first presented her research a decade ago. Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai stopped allowing itself to be used as a dumping ground for relocated leopards. (Like Junnar, it was also experiencing an outbreak of deadly attacks.) The city’s media took up the idea that relocations were more dangerous than the leopards. Workshops for apartment dwellers around the park, and for residents of slums inside the park borders, began to promulgate the larger idea that merely seeing a leopard in the neighborhood does not constitute “conflict.” Removing leopards—the first thing city dwellers often demand—disrupts the social system and opens the territory for new leopards that may be less experienced at the tricky business of “mutual accommodation.” The workshops also emphasized the human side of mutual accommodation, including basic precautions like keeping children indoors at night. (Larger public health measures would also help, including garbage removal, provision of toilets, and removal of street dogs, but economic and political factors often put them out of reach.) The abiding message was that leopards in Mumbai, Akole, and other areas are not “strays” or “intruders.” They are fellow residents.\nWith plenty of prey and few competitors, leopards are abundant in Sri Lanka’s Yala National Park. Tourism is booming as people flock to see the animals, which roam both day and night.\nLiving by these ideas has not, however, always been easy. This is especially so for forest department rangers who show up in the aftermath of a leopard attack, and find themselves besieged and even beaten by enraged residents demanding action. They also come under pressure from local politicians. So the traps still come out, to give people the illusion of something being done, of safety, even if the actual result is to increase their danger. A few “problem” leopards end up being warehoused at crowded “rescue” facilities around the country, though there is in fact no way to identify a problem animal, short of catching it with its victim. A scapegoat will do.\nThus soon after the latest killings in Junnar, a forest ranger there emailed me: “Glad to inform you that we trapped a male leopard.” He identified it flatly as “the same leopard which attacked a boy last month.” It would spend the rest of its life at a “leopard rescue” facility in Junnar, which was already close to capacity, with 28 leopards. Most of the other leopards being caught in traps inevitably would be released, though for obvious reasons the forest department would not disclose how many leopards it was releasing in Junnar, or where. Two weeks after that, another leopard killed and dismembered a 60-year-old woman at a farm a few miles from where Sai Mandlik died.\nI left India thinking that what I had seen of leopards there was a messy, difficult business, far removed from the way people live in more developed countries. Then I arrived home to an unverified report of a mountain lion four miles from my home on the Connecticut coast, followed by news of a black bear in the nearby city of New Haven. Mountain lions now roam through Los Angeles , coyotes in Chicago, wolves on the outskirts of Rome, great white sharks off Cape Cod. As human populations expand and we make the Earth more urban, other carnivores also seem to be adapting and learning to hang on in our midst. This can be unnerving, but it’s not necessarily a bad thing: Studies have repeatedly shown that healthy predator populations are essential to the health of almost everything else. If they are not gods, they are at least the great drivers of ecosystems.\nGradually, the Indian experience of leopards began to seem less like an otherworldly exception and more like a foreshadowing of how all of us may soon be learning to live.\nOn a hill overlooking Mumbai a man-made water hole attracts one of an estimated 35 leopards living in and around Sanjay Gandhi National Park.\nNational Geographic’s Big Cats Initiative is dedicated to halting the decline of wild felines around the world.

Khalid has rattled his 4X4 over a plateau of jagged rocks to bring us to the rim of the Jabal Samhanescarpment, a 4,265ft-high rock shelf sloping down to a coastal plain. Except we can\'t see the coast. Or the plain. Below us is nothing but a thick, all-concealing blanket of cloud, a rolling neverland of muffled white spreading to the horizon.\n"OK," says Khalid, turning from the view, tilting his wide-brimmed hat and looking me in the eye. "Leopards." We\'ve come to the Jabal Samhan Nature Reserve, high up in the Dhofar region of southern Oman, in search of endangered Arabian leopards. Although that\'s probably the wrong way of putting it. Khalid works for the Office for Conservation of the Environment and has been monitoring the reserve for 12 years, during which time he\'s caught sight of just three leopards. Are there Arabian leopards here? Absolutely. The data suggests there are around 20. Are we likely to see one? No chance.\nFrom our vantage point above the clouds, Khalid explains that long ago, with livestock herders and man-made settlements encroaching on the land above and below the escarpment, the leopards retreated to the only place they could — the steep, scrubby slopes of the escarpment itself. At around 60 miles in length, however, that\'s a significant territory for 20 animals. "Arabian leopards are about half the size of African leopards, but very strong," he continues. "One leopard can take down a camel. You need 10 men to do that."\nAs Arabia\'s biggest cat, the leopard is now protected by royal decree. The plan today is to check the images from one of the escarpment\'s two-dozen camera traps, put in place to monitor the animals\' behaviour. We begin a long, steep descent down a rocky gully, scrambling around boulders and levering ourselves over tree roots until we reach a flatter lip of land partway down the slope. A scarred cliff bellies out above us. The land below is still all cloud, all hidden. Other than the constant dry whirr of insects, it feels as though we\'re walking through a dream. \xa0\nHalf an hour later, Khalid stops on the trail and points to a low rock. Strung to it is a camera trap. He clicks it open and removes the memory card, and we sit in the thin shade of a tree to check the images. I feel tenser than I thought I would. Suddenly, the silent rubbly path we\'ve been following becomes something more: a place where wildlife roams. A thin fox slinking past. A rock hyrax, goofing at the camera. Another fox. A prowling honey badger. But no leopards.\nWe sit under the tree, downing water and staring out at the escarpment. There\'s a faint herby scent in the air. In the heat, the quiet is immense. Eventually, we begin walking back. Khalid outlines one of the trickier elements of his job, which is having to compensate local farmers whose animals are attacked by leopards. "We had to start doing it, because they were shooting at the leopards," he says. "We pay 100 rials (around £200) for a goat, 300 rials for a cow and 500 rials for a camel."\nI dare to ask him whether, after 12 years, he ever yearns for a job elsewhere. He looks at me as though I\'m mad, then gestures at the yawning belt of sun-blasted overhangs and craggy angles. "No. I love to work here," he says. "I feel the leopards. I always feel the leopards. They\'re in my blood."\nTo arrange a trek to one of Jabal Sahman\'s camera traps, contact Khalid Al Hakmani (kmdhikmani@hotmail.com) a few weeks in advance of your trip.
